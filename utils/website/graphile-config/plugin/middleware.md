# Middleware

_Target Audience: plugin authors ðŸ”Œ and library authors ðŸ“š_

Some libraries may choose to make a middleware system available to plugins,
allowing plugin authors to wrap specific library procedures with their own
code, and even to skip the execution or replace the result of these procedures.

Each procedure that a library exposes through the middleware system is called
an "action", and has a unique name, the "action name." A plugin may register a
callback, called a "middleware function" or simply a "middleware," against zero
or more actions. Middleware functions are called with a `next` function which
invokes the underlying action, and a mutable `event` object that describes the
context under which the middleware is being called; they return the result of
calling `next`, or a replacement result to use in its place.

By adding middleware to a plugin, you can:

- run logic before the library's underlying action by including code before
  `next()`,
- run logic after the library's underlying action by including code after
  `next()` but before returning,
- omit calling the underlying action and further middleware by not calling
  `next()` (not recommended unless the library notes this is expected),
- call the underlying action and following middleware more than once by calling
  `next()` multiple times (not recommended unless the library notes this is
  expected), and
- mutate the `event` object to change the behaviour of further middleware and
  the underlying action (not recommended unless the library notes this is
  expected, typically in the TSDoc comments for the various event properties).

The following example plugin includes a middleware that adds a naive retry and
backoff to the underlying `someAction` action. Note that this example would
only be safe if the library explicitly states that calling `next()` more than
once is safe (and even then, it may be unsafe if other middleware don't handle
this well).

```ts title="my-some-action-retry-plugin.ts"
export const MySomeActionRetryPlugin: GraphileConfig.Plugin = {
  name: "MySomeActionRetryPlugin",
  myScopeName: {
    middleware: {
      async someAction(next, event) {
        console.log(`someAction(someParameter=${event.someParameter}) called`);

        let error!: Error;
        for (let attempts = 0; attempts < 3; attempts++) {
          if (attempts > 0) {
            // Wait a few milliseconds before trying again
            await sleep(attempts * 5);
          }
          try {
            return await next();
          } catch (e) {
            error = e;
          }
        }
        throw error;
      },
    },
  },
};
```

Middleware functions are executed when libraries call `middleware.run()` or
`middleware.runSync()`. For example:

```ts
const actionResult = await middleware.run(
  // The "action name"
  "someAction",

  // The `event` object
  { someParameter: 42 },

  // The "underlying action"; this function is what will be retried if the
  // MySomeActionRetryPlugin is included in a preset.
  async (event) => {
    // Extract the (possibly modified) values from the event
    const { someParameter } = event;

    // Do something:
    return doTheThing(someParameter);
  },
);
```

Multiple plugins in a preset can register middleware for the same action. When
middleware functions call `next()`, the next registered middleware is run. Once
there are no more registered middleware functions for that action, `next()` will
perform the underlying action that the library defines.

:::danger Here be dragons

When you write a middleware, you are explicitly choosing to change the way in
which a library functions&mdash;your modified behaviour may not be compatible
with the expectations of the library, which may result in subtle and
not-so-subtle bugs. In particular, most libraries and most middleware will not
function correctly if you:

- omit `next()`,
- call `next()` more than once,
- return a promise when the middleware is expected to be synchronous, or
- change the `event` in an unexpected way.

Refer to the documentation for the appropriate library to see the available
actions around which you can add middleware, the structure of the `event`, and
whether the middleware are
[synchronous or asynchronous](#synchronous-middleware).

:::

:::note The underlying action might be a no-op

Some libraries may call middleware with no underlying action (aka no operation
or "no-op"); typically this allows for middleware to be called at a "point in
time" rather than _around_ a specific action. This has no effect on how you
should write a middleware function for these actions.

:::

## Synchronous middleware

Libraries use `middleware.runSync()` when the underlying action is synchronous
and the library expects any middleware function run around that action to be
synchronous. If you return a promise from a synchronous middleware function,
Graphile Config will throw an error.

Libraries should document whether their middleware are synchronous or
asynchronous, but you may be able to tell from the library's TypeScript types:
asynchronous middleware functions' return types generally incorporate `Promise`
or `PromiseLike`.

Unless you are certain a given middleware supports promises, you should not use
`async`/`await`. Instead, use `next.callback(...)` if you need to execute some
code once the action is complete.

## `next.callback()`

`next.callback()` simplifies including code after `next`, regardless of whether
`next` succeeds or fails.

Using `next.callback()` also allows you to introduce a promise only if one is
already present. This lets you avoid the performance overhead of promises when
they are not necessary, and it allows your function to be used as either
synchronous or asynchronous middleware.

```ts
export const MySpecialPlugin: GraphileConfig.Plugin = {
  name: "MySpecialPlugin",
  libraryName: {
    middleware: {
      someAction(next, event) {
        console.log(`someAction(someParameter=${event.someParameter}) called`);
        // Optionally mutate event
        event.someParameter = event.someParameter * 2;

        return next.callback((error, result) => {
          if (error) {
            console.error(`someAction() threw ${error}`);
            // Handle the error somehow... Or just rethrow it.
            throw error;
          } else {
            console.log(`someAction() returned ${result}`);
            // Return `result` or a derivative thereof
            return result / 2;
          }
        });
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## Middleware order

Most middleware are registered and executed in
[the order the plugins are loaded](./index.md#plugin-order). Sometimes,
middleware in the same plugin have varying requirements for when they are run.
For this reason, middleware also support `before`, `after`, and `provides`.
These properties function similarly to how they are used to
[order plugins](./index.md#plugin-order), but Graphile Config uses them to
individually sort the middleware for each scoped action.

In the following example, the `bar` middleware in the `libraryName` scope has an
order constraint at the middleware level. The `bar` middleware in `MyPlugin`
will be run after the `bar` middleware in `OtherPlugin` if both plugins are used
in the same resolved preset.

```ts
export const MyPlugin: GraphileConfig.Plugin = {
  name: "MyPlugin",
  // Plugins can have default order constraints at the plugin level and can
  // override them at the middleware level.
  // This states that by default, middleware in MyPlugin will be executed
  // before any other plugins' middleware that provides 'featureA'.
  before: ["featureA"],
  libraryName: {
    middleware: {
      foo(next) {
        // ... do something
        return next();
      },

      bar: {
        after: ["featureB"],
        async callback(next) {
          // Executed after middleware that provides 'featureB'
          console.log("MyPlugin");
          try {
            return await next();
          } finally {
            console.log("/MyPlugin");
          }
        },
      },
    },
  },
};

export const OtherPlugin: GraphileConfig.Plugin = {
  name: "OtherPlugin",
  libraryName: {
    middleware: {
      bar: {
        provides: ["featureB"],
        async callback(next) {
          console.log("OtherPlugin");
          try {
            return await next();
          } finally {
            console.log("/OtherPlugin");
          }
        },
      },
    },
  },
};

/* Result of executing the `bar` action:

OtherPlugin
MyPlugin
/MyPlugin
/OtherPlugin

*/
```

Similar to plugins' `provides` property, Graphile Config appends the plugin
`name` to the `provides` property for all middleware.
