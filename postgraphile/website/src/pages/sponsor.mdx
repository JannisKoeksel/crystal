  Graphile has a number of crowd-funded open-source projects, licensed under the
  permissive MIT license, including PostGraphile, Gra<em>fast</em>, Graphile
  Worker, Graphile Migrate and Graphile Starter. Sponsorship increases the rate
  of fixes, documentation improvements, and feature development on these and
  other projects.{" "}

## Why are Graphile projects &ldquo;crowd-funded open-source&rdquo;?

Many of our projects are open-source to give users great freedom in how they use
the software, and to enable the community to have influence over how the projects
progress to make it appropriate for a wide range of use-cases. To ensure users can
rely on these projects for years to come, they need to be well directed and
financially sustainable.

**The best way to ensure that Graphile software is something you can depend on for
years to come is through monthly sponsorship.** Crowd-sourced funding enables us to
spend the most time directly working on improving the software, which you and other
users then benefit from.

## Sponsor tiers &amp; benefits

As well as ensuring the sustainability and longevity of PostGraphile and the
wider Graphile suite of developer tooling, sponsorship also gives you or your
company some benefits. Choose the tier which matches your funding goal, higher
tiers come with more benefits. It is recommended Enterprises join at the private
advisor tier, which comes with a Development Support contract and includes access
to a discounted consultancy rate.
