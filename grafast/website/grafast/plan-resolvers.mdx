# Plan resolvers

When planning a GraphQL operation, we combine the plans from every field
requested in the operation into an execution plan that we then optimize. "Field
plan resolvers" are the functions that detail the plan for each field (there
can also be plan resolvers on arguments, input fields, and even enum values;
but that's more advanced than most people need).

Plan resolvers are synchronous (they must not return promises) since they do
not deal with actual runtime data, instead detailing the steps needed to
process all possible data that will be seen at runtime.

## Field plan resolvers

At operation planning time, each time a field is referenced that field's plan
resolver will be called and the result will be combined into the operation
plan. When calling the field's resolver, <Grafast /> will pass the "parent
step" and a "field args" object. The plan resolver may create as many
intermediate steps as it likes, but it must return exactly one step that
represents the result of the field.

In the case of a field that has a polymorphic type, the step that is returned
must be a polymorphic-capable plan (see [polymorphism](./polymorphism.mdx)). In
the case of a field that has a list type, the step that is returned must
produce lists when executed.

A plan resolver can be used instead of, or in addition to, a traditional
resolver. Since plan resolvers run only when the operation is being planned, not
when it is being executed, they do not have access to any data ─ only other
steps.

Like regular resolvers, the first two arguments to a plan resolver represent the
parent data and the arguments respectively. However, since we're dealing in
potentials rather than concrete data, both of these are a little different:

### Parent step

The first argument, the "parent step," is a step that represents the data from
the parent. When the parent field has an object type, the "parent step" is
simply the step that the parent field resolved to. When the parent field has a
list or polymorphic type, the "parent step" will be the resolved step that
represents an entry from the list or the concrete object type for polymorphism.

### Field arguments

The second argument, the "field arguments" (`fieldArgs`), is an object with
access methods to read the arguments. We'll expand on that below in the
[FieldArgs](#fieldargs) section.

### Example

A plan resolver might look something like:

```ts
function plan_resolver(
  $parent: ExecutableStep,
  args: FieldArgs,
): ExecutableStep {
  const $friends = $parent.getRelation("friends");
  $friends.limit(args.get("limit"));
  return $friends;
}
```

:::note

By convention, when a variable represents a step we start the variable's name
with a `$`.

:::

Of course the actual body of the plan resolver function will vary based on your
own application's needs.

## Execution order &amp; side effects

Grafast is **declarative**: steps form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and only dependencies determine order. There is no implicit procedural sequencing. Two rules matter:

1. Dependencies before dependents.
2. Steps **implicitly** depend on the previous side effect step, if any.

This can be surprising during mutations: steps created before a mutation might
execute **after** the mutation unless one of the rules above says otherwise.

### Example

```ts
const $before = users.get({ id: $rowId });
const $valueBefore = $before.get("value1");

const $after = updateUser($rowId);
const $valueAfter = $after.get("value1");

const $log = sideEffect(
  [$valueBefore, $valueAfter],
  ([before, after]) => void console.log({ before, after })
);
```

**Default graph (no extra side effects):**

<Mermaid chart={`
${init}
  $log:::plan
  $before:::plan --> $valueBefore:::plan --> $log
  $after:::plan --> $valueAfter:::plan --> $log
  class $log,$after sideeffectplan
  class $before,$valueBefore,$after,$valueAfter,$log bucket0
`} />

The engine may execute `$after` (mutation) before `$valueBefore`, because
nothing forbids it according to the two rules above.

**Force “read-before-write” by marking `$valueBefore` as a side effect:**

```diff
 const $before = users.get({ id: $rowId });
 const $valueBefore = $before.get("value1");
+$valueBefore.hasSideEffect = true;

 const $after = updateUser($rowId);
 const $valueAfter = $after.get("value1");

 const $log = sideEffect(
   [$valueBefore, $valueAfter],
   ([before, after]) => void console.log({ before, after })
 );
```

This adds an _implicit_ edge from `$valueBefore` to later steps (including `$after`):

<Mermaid chart={`
${init}
  $log:::plan
  $before:::plan --> $valueBefore:::plan --> $log
  $after:::plan --> $valueAfter:::plan --> $log
  $valueBefore -.-o $after
  class $log,$after,$valueBefore sideeffectplan
  class $before,$valueBefore,$after,$valueAfter,$log bucket0
`} />

Now `$valueBefore` must run before `$after`, so your log shows the true “before” and “after”.

### When to use which

- Prefer **explicit data deps** when possible (e.g. make the read feed the write).
- Use `hasSideEffect = true` when you need **ordering without data flow** (logging, metrics, authorization gates, idempotency checks).
- Don’t sprinkle `hasSideEffect` on hot paths unnecessarily; it reduces reordering freedom.

## Specifying a field plan resolver

When building a GraphQL schema programatically, plan resolvers are stored into
`extensions.grafast.plan` of the field; for example:

```ts {9-15}
import { GraphQLSchema, GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLInt } from "graphql";
import { constant } from "grafast";

const Query = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: "Query",
  fields: {
    meaningOfLife: {
      type: GraphQLInt,
      extensions: {
        grafast: {
          plan() {
            return constant(42);
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});

export const schema = new GraphQLSchema({
  query: Query,
});
```

If you are using `makeGrafastSchema` then the field plan resolver for the field
`fieldName` on the object type `typeName` would be indicated via the
`objects[typeName].plans[fieldName]` property:

```ts {12-14}
import { makeGrafastSchema, constant } from "grafast";

export const schema = makeGrafastSchema({
  typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
    type Query {
      meaningOfLife: Int
    }
  `,
  objects: {
    Query: {
      plans: {
        meaningOfLife() {
          return constant(42);
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Asserting an object type's step

Object types in Gra*fast* can indicate that they must be represented by a
particular step or set of steps to guarantee that the methods on those steps
are available to the field plan resolvers; this can help to catch bugs early.

This indication takes one of two forms, either it's explicitly the step class
itself, or it's an assertion function that checks that the incoming step is of
an appropriate type and throws an error otherwise.

When defining a schema programatically, `assertStep` is defined via
`objectTypeConfig.extensions.grafast.assertStep`, for example:

```ts {8-14}
import { GraphQLObjectType } from "graphql";
import { ObjectStep } from "grafast";

const MyObject = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: "MyObject",
  extensions: {
    grafast: {
      assertStep: ObjectStep,
      /* Or:
        assertStep($step) {
          if ($step instanceof ObjectStep) return;
          throw new Error(`Type 'MyObject' expects a step of type ObjectStep; instead received a step of type '${$step.constructor.name}'`);
        }
       */
    },
  },
  fields: {
    a: {
      extensions: {
        grafast: {
          plan($obj: ObjectStep) {
            return $obj.get("a");
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

When defined via `makeGrafastSchema` we cannot call the property `assertStep`
directly as it might conflict with a field name, so instead we use
`assertStep`, knowing that GraphQL forbids fields to start with `__` (two
underscores) since those names are reserved for introspection:

```ts {11-17}
import { makeGrafastSchema, ObjectStep } from "grafast";

const schema = makeGrafastSchema({
  typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
    type MyObject {
      a: Int
    }
  `,
  objects: {
    MyObject: {
      assertStep: ObjectStep,
      /* Or:
        assertStep($step) {
          if ($step instanceof ObjectStep) return;
          throw new Error(`Type 'MyObject' expects a step of type ObjectStep; instead received a step of type '${$step.constructor.name}'`);
        }
       */
      plans: {
        a($obj: ObjectStep) {
          return $obj.get("a");
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

:::tip

Generally adding a step assertion is optional; however when there's a union or
interface type all types within it must agree whether a step is expected or
not. If you want to require steps everywhere but you don't care for a particular
type what the step actually is, you can use `assertStep: ExecutableStep` or
`assertStep: () => true`.

## Argument and input field plan resolvers

**THIS CONTENT IS WRONG!** TODO: update this to reflect the beta2 changes.

:::tip

This section is very advanced and rarely used, so feel free to skip to the next
subsection. It's included here only because FieldArgs (the next section) relies
on these behaviors if present.

:::

In addition to field plan resolvers, Gra*fast* allows you to attach an `inputPlan`
and/or an `applyPlan` to individual arguments or to input fields on input
objects. These plan resolvers work a little differently.

### `inputPlan` plan resolvers

An `inputPlan` plan resolver may exist on an argument or an input field. It is
passed three arguments:

1. the parent plan
2. the FieldArgs relative to this argument or input field
3. additional info (TODO: document)

The `inputPlan` must return a step that shall be used in place of the argument
or input value's raw value when `FieldArgs.get` references it.

### `applyPlan` plan resolvers

An `applyPlan` plan resolver may exist on an argument or an input field. It is
passed three arguments:

1. the target step - the step to apply changes to
2. the FieldArgs relative to this argument or input field
3. additional info (TODO: document)

The `applyPlan` may either manipulate the target step directly, or it may return
a ModifierStep which will gather changes and then apply them all at once. The
ModifierStep is passed to child input fields `applyPlan` plan resolvers (if any)
to allow the changes to stack up. This is particularly useful when building
"patch" objects to be used with a mutation, or "filter" objects to be used
against a collection.

## FieldArgs

The `FieldArgs` object gives access to the arguments of a field (when used in a
field plan resolver) or to the input fields of an input object (when used for
`applyPlan`/`inputPlan`) or similar for other inputs. It contains three methods:

### FieldArgs.get

Pass this method either the name of the argument you wish to get, or a path to
the value you want through arguments and input objects (_but not lists_), and
you shall receive a step that represents that value.

If the argument or input object field has an `inputPlan` method, it will be
called, and the step that it returns will be used instead of the raw step that
would represent the value.

:::note

You may also call `fieldArgs.get()` with no arguments to get the value of the
current argument/input field; but this may only be done inside `inputPlan` or
`applyPlan`.

:::

### FieldArgs.getRaw

As FieldArgs.get, except it ignores any `inputPlan`s and just returns a step
representing the raw value.

### FieldArgs.apply

Pass this method a step to apply to and either the name of the argument you wish
to apply, or a path to the input field you want to apply through arguments and
input objects (_but not lists_), and the `applyPlan` for that argument or input
field will be applied to the given step.

TODO: expand this section with examples of why you might do these things.

## ~~Automatic application of `applyPlan` plan resolvers~~

:::danger

~~This section is now _wrong_. We changed this behavior, and now you need to add
`autoApplyAfterParentApplyPlan` or similar in order to trigger your field to
auto-apply (or `autoApplyAfterParentPlan` for an argument).~~

Now even the statement this is wrong, is itself wrong...

TODO: fix this documentation.

:::

~~FieldArgs keeps track of the arguments/input fields that you `.get()`,
`.getRaw()` or `.apply()`, and should there be any left unaccessed that have an
`applyPlan` method, these will automatically be called passing the field plan
resolver's resulting step as the argument.~~

~~This, for example, allows you to associate the "first" behavior with the
argument rather than the plan resolver, such that you could share the
first/last/before/after behavior via a common object that you spread into each
of your arguments on connections, rather than having to rewrite the logic in
each of your plan resolver functions.~~
