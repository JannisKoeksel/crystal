    Graphile projects are &ldquo;crowd-funded open-source&rdquo;
  </div>
</div>
}

Many of our projects are open-source under the permissive MIT license to give users great freedom in how they use
the software, and to enable the community to have influence over how the projects
progress to make it appropriate for a wide range of use-cases. To ensure users can
rely on these projects for years to come, they need to be well directed and
financially sustainable.

**The best way to ensure that Graphile software is something you can depend on for
years to come is through monthly sponsorship.** Crowd-sourced funding enables us to
spend the most time directly working on improving the software, which you and other
users then benefit from.
