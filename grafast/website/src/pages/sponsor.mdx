Graphile has a number of crowd-funded open-source projects, licensed under the
permissive MIT license, including PostGraphile, Gra<em>fast</em>, Graphile Worker,
Graphile Migrate and Graphile Starter. Sponsorship increases
the rate of fixes, documentation improvements, and feature development on these
and other projects.

  <div className={styles.instructionSponsor}>
    Graphile projects are &ldquo;crowd-funded open-source&rdquo;
  </div>
</div>
}

Many of our projects are open-source to give users great freedom in how they use
the software, and to enable the community to have influence over how the projects
progress to make it appropriate for a wide range of use-cases. To ensure users can
rely on these projects for years to come, they need to be well directed and
financially sustainable.

**The best way to ensure that Graphile software is something you can depend on for
years to come is through monthly sponsorship.** Crowd-sourced funding enables us to
spend the most time directly working on improving the software, which you and other
users then benefit from.

}

As well as ensuring the sustainability and longevity of PostGraphile and the
wider Graphile suite of developer tooling, sponsorship also gives you or your
company some benefits. Choose the tier which matches your funding goal, higher
tiers come with more benefits.
