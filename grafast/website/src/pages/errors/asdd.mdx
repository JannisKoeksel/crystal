# addStepDependency - Deleted

Examples:

```
Cannot add [...] as a dependency of [...]; the latter is deleted!
Cannot add [...] as a dependency of [...]; the former is deleted!
```

You've received this error because you've attempted to add a dependency between
two steps, but one (or more) of those steps have been deleted. Typically this
occurs when you cache a step &mdash; either as a property somewhere or in a
closure &mdash; and that step is deduplicated, tree shaken, or otherwise
disposed of before you come to reference it.

It's common to see this issue when using `each()`:

```ts title="Broken code"
function plan($source) {
  const $ids = get($source, "relatedIds");
  // highlight-next-line
  const $db = context().get("db");
  return each($ids, ($id) => {
    return loadOne({ lookup: $id, unary: $db, load: batchGetThingById });
  });
}
```

Here the callback to `each()` references `$db` from the higher closure, but if
this step were to have deduplicated before the each callback is called, you'd be
handling a deleted step.

The solution is to ensure that closures you use never capture steps from a
higher level; typically the solution is to move the fetching of the data into
the callback:

```ts title="Fixed code"
function plan($source) {
  const $ids = get($source, "relatedIds");
  return each($ids, ($id) => {
    // highlight-next-line
    const $db = context().get("db");
    return loadOne({ lookup: $id, unary: $db, load: batchGetThingById });
  });
}
```

Now the closure doesn't reference any extant `$steps` from outside of the
closure, it is passed or constructs the steps it needs.

TODO: make these lint rules ;)

:::info Why don't we solve this automatically?

Gra*fast* internally tracks which step IDs have been replaced with others; we
could make it so when you add a dependency on a replaced step, it instead
references the replacement. This would indeed solve this particular error, but
it would open a more nefarious can of worms: you might not realise that the step
that you are handling has been replaced by another, and you might send the
deleted version instructions such as "load this attribute" or "include a
cursor". Since the step is no longer in the operation plan, these instructions
would never go anywhere, meaning that your code would look like it should work
but you'd get issues in certain operations.

Rather than introducing the potential for subtle errors into your project, we
decided it would be better to surface this kind of issue more explicitly so you
can fix the root cause.
